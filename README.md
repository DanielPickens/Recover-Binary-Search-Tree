# Recover-Binary-Search-Tree
My solution to the Medium Leetcode - Recovery Binary Search Tree. Faster than 100%


"You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1"
